## Dataset Exploration
### Dataset Summary
There are 34799 training examples, 4410 validation samples and 12630 test samples. Each image is of size 32x32 and has 3 color channels. The total number of image classes in the training set is 43. 

### Exploratory Visualization
A first look at the typical images in the dataset (taking any random 2 for the report).

## Design and Test a Model Architecture
### Preprocessing

#### Brightness

A casual observation showed that most of the images had low levels of brightness. A very simple algorithm was used to increase the brighness and these images were added back to the training set. This did not have a large impact on the improving the accuracy of the prediction during validation runs.  

#### Random Oversampling

A google search provided some explanation on how to handle the training set data imbalance on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-train-convolutional-neural-networks-on-highly-unbalanced-datasets) pointed to a recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05381.pdf). A simple random oversampling was used to remove this imbalance. To counter the negative side effect of overfitting, a dropout was added to the neural network. 

The resultant distribution was as shown below. **This step single handedly improved the validation result to ~95%.** However, the negative impact was the large size of the dataset, which was now - 172860.

#### RGB to Grayscale
The images were then converted to grayscale. 

#### Normalization
Each image was then normalized to center around 0 mean and sd.
